# NBA Hall Of Fame Model

*Project in beginning stages

In the eyes of voters, what makes an NBA player worthy of induction into the [Basketball Hall of Fame](https://www.hoophall.com/)?

We are using player stats and allocades scraped from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) to predict whether an NBA player will be inducted into the Hall of Fame once they are eligible. Specifically, we hope to train a model to accurately identify Hall of Fame players across NBA history. Then, using this model, we will predict the current Hall of Fame likelihood of active NBA players based on their in-game statistics and awards.
